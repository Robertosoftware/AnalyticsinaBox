#Login with Service Principal - Make sure you login and run deployment with a user that has a high enough RBAC to create role assignments (Owner Role). 
az login --service-principal --username $appID --password $password --tenant $TenantID 

#1. Create your Resource Group where you are going to land all your Synapse Resources and Dependencies
az group create --name $rgName --location $location

#2. Build and convert your Bicep file to an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)
#(Make sure that you run the below command within the src/bicep-deployment directory. So change directory (cd) at the command prompt)
az bicep build --file main.bicep

#3. Deploy your Bicep template to Azure 
az deployment group create --resource-group $rgName --template-file $BicepFile --parameters $parameterFile --verbose

#4. Clean Up the Resources and Delete the Resource Group
#az group delete --name $rgName

#5. Decompile ARM template
#az bicep decompile --file template.json

#Note - RUN THE FOLLOWING AZURE CLI COMMAND. You are going to need to GET your Service Principal ID If you run the deployment with Azure DevOps. 
#The service principal ID is different. You can get your Service Principal Application ID and Service Principal Object ID from the Portal but not the ID. 
#So you need to get your Service Principal ID if you run the deployment through Azure DevOps
#az ad sp show --id <YourServicePrincipalAppID>
